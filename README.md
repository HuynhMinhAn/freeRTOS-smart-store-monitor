# FreeRTOS Smart Store Monitor

This project implements a real-time smart store monitoring system using ESP32 and FreeRTOS. It tracks customer entry/exit, measures temperature and humidity, and provides fire alerts with OLED display and buzzer support.

## Author

## Features
- Dual ultrasonic sensors to count people entering and leaving
- DHT22 sensor to monitor temperature and humidity
- OLED screen displays:
  - Current number of people
  - Total entries
  - Temperature and humidity
  - Fire alert if temperature exceeds threshold
- Fire alert with buzzer and LED
- Uses FreeRTOS: 5 tasks + 1 software timer + semaphore for alarm handling
