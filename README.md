# FreeRTOS Smart Store Monitor

This project implements a real-time smart store monitoring system using ESP32 and FreeRTOS. It tracks customer entry/exit, measures temperature and humidity, and provides fire alerts with OLED display and buzzer support.

## Features
- Dual ultrasonic sensors to count people entering and leaving
- DHT22 sensor to monitor temperature and humidity
- OLED screen displays:
  - Current number of people
  - Total entries
  - Temperature and humidity
  - Fire alert if temperature exceeds threshold
- Fire alert with buzzer and LED
- Uses FreeRTOS: 5 tasks + 1 software timer + semaphore for alarm handling

## RTOS Task Overview
| Task                  | Priority | Description                          |
|-----------------------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| EntryTask             | 2        | Detects people entering              |
| ExitTask              | 2        | Detects people leaving               |
| SendSemaphoreTask     | 1        | Reads DHT, sends alarm if needed     |
| ReceiveSemaphoreTask  | 3        | Triggers buzzer alert                |
| LightControlTask      | 3        | Controls LED based on light/button   |
| LCD TimerCallback     | -        | Updates OLED display every 2s        |

## Getting Started
